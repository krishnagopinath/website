I'm a **software engineer**, **budding teacher** and an **amateur photographer**.

I enjoy building thoughtfully designed applications that solve complex problems in the simplest way possible.

As a software engineer at <Link href="https://patch.com" target="_blank">Patch</Link>, I help build Typescript apps and APIs using Next.js, React, AWS Lambda, Node.js, Terraform, Kubernetes, MongoDB, DynamoDB & MySQL.
In the past, I've worked extensively with Vue.js, Svelte, Apache Cordova, C#, ASP.NET & SQL Server.

I'm currently toying with web tooling, serverless paradigms, Rust and headless CMS systems.

During my free time, I could be doing any of the following:

- Rewriting <Link href="https://github.com/Matterwiki/Matterwiki/tree/refactor" target="_blank">Matterwiki</Link>, a simple wiki for small teams.
- Trying to build a habit of <Link href="/posts" target="_blank">writing</Link>.
- Capturing <Link href="https://www.instagram.com/krishwader" target="_blank">pictures of food, places and architecture</Link>.
- Cooking vegetarian recipes from a multitude of cuisines.

I currently live in Chicago. 📌
