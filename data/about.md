I'm a **software engineer**, **budding teacher** and an **amateur photographer**.

I enjoy building thoughtfully designed applications that solve problems in the simplest way possible.

I have about 7 years of experience building web and mobile apps using React, Vue.js, AngularJS, cordova, Node.js, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server and MySQL. I'm currently toying with Go, GraphQL and GatsbyJS.

My work principles are to strive to be iterative, communicative and thorough. It is my belief that once we have these in place, we'd be able to work wonders in the jobs we do.

During my free time, I could be doing any of the following:

- Rewriting [Matterwiki](https://github.com/Matterwiki/Matterwiki/tree/refactor), a simple wiki for small teams.
- [Reading source code](https://github.com/krishnagopinath?tab=stars) that I find interesting and potentially contributing to it.
- Capturing [pictures of food, places and architecture](https://www.instagram.com/krishwader).
- Cooking vegetarian recipes from a multitude of cuisines.

I currently live in Buffalo, NY. üìç
