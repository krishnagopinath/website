I'm a **software engineer**, **budding teacher** and an **amateur photographer**.

I enjoy building thoughtfully designed applications that solve problems in the simplest way possible. 

As a software engineer at  <ExternalLink href="https://patch.com">Patch</ExternalLink>, I help build Typescript apps and APIs using Next.js, React, AWS Lambda, Node.js, Terraform, Kubernetes, MongoDB, DynamoDB & MySQL. 
In the past, I've worked extensively with Vue.js, Svelte, Apache Cordova, C#, ASP.NET & SQL Server. 

I'm currently toying with web tooling, serverless paradigms, Rust and headless CMS systems.

My work principles are to strive to be _iterative_, _communicative_ and _thorough_. It is my belief that once we have these in place, we'd be able to work wonders in the jobs we do.

During my free time, I could be doing any of the following:

- Rewriting <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/Matterwiki/Matterwiki/tree/refactor">Matterwiki</ExternalLink>, a simple wiki for small teams.
- Trying to build a habit of <InternalLink to="/posts">writing</InternalLink>.
- Capturing <ExternalLink href="https://www.instagram.com/krishwader">pictures of food, places and architecture</ExternalLink>.
- Cooking vegetarian recipes from a multitude of cuisines.

I currently live in New York. üóΩ üçé üìç
