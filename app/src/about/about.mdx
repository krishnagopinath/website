## Hello, I'm Krishna 👋

<ResumeLinks />

I'm a **software engineer**, **budding teacher** and an **amateur photographer**.

I enjoy building thoughtfully designed applications that solve problems in the simplest way possible. 

As a software engineer at [Patch](https://patch.com), I help build Typescript apps and APIs using Next.js, React, AWS Lambda, Node.js, Terraform, Kubernetes, MongoDB, DynamoDB & MySQL. 
In the past, I've worked extensively with Vue.js, Svelte, Apache Cordova, C#, ASP.NET & SQL Server. 

I'm currently toying with web tooling, serverless paradigms, Rust and headless CMS systems.

My work principles are to strive to be _iterative_, _communicative_ and _thorough_. It is my belief that once we have these in place, we'd be able to work wonders in the jobs we do.

During my free time, I could be doing any of the following:

- Rewriting [Matterwiki](https://github.com/Matterwiki/Matterwiki/tree/refactor), a simple wiki for small teams.
- Capturing [pictures of food, places and architecture](https://www.instagram.com/krishwader).
- Cooking vegetarian recipes from a multitude of cuisines.

I currently live in New York. 🗽 🍎 📍
