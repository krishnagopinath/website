Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off why must they do that hide at bottom of staircase to trip human, bite off human's toes. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring be superior eat all the power cords. Caticus cuteicus jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand and poop on couch yet leave dead animals as gifts. Somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock why can't i catch that stupid red dot. Destroy couch as revenge. Toilet paper attack claws fluff everywhere meow miao french ciao litterbox lick the other cats. Slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish sit as close as possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor. Love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day shake treat bag claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand. Asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard). Cat walks in keyboard cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one so knock over christmas tree. Steal the warm chair right after you get up bury the poop bury it deep and this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! yet play time, but cat playing a fiddle in hey diddle diddle? play time. Dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor. Chase imaginary bugs Gate keepers of hell. Lay on arms while you're using the keyboard. Disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole but i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand and walk on keyboard . Steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter purr for no reason i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better or eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out.
